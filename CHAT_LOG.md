# Delay Discounting Task Development Chat Log

## Project Overview
Development of a 5-trial adjusting delay discounting task based on Koffarnus & Bickel (2014) methodology, implemented with jsPsych for both standalone browser use and Qualtrics integration.

## Conversation Summary

### Initial Setup and Understanding
- **User**: Asked what the `main.js` file does
- **Assistant**: Explained it implements a 5-trial adaptive delay discounting task using jsPsych, starting at delay index 16 (3 weeks) and adjusting by 8/4/2/1 based on choices
- **User**: Asked how `index.html` and `main.js` work together
- **Assistant**: Explained `index.html` loads jsPsych libraries and `main.js`, then initializes and runs the timeline

### Code Optimization
- **User**: Asked if the task could be done more efficiently
- **Assistant**: Refactored five duplicate trials into a single loop-driven template, fixed "1 years" label, added bounds checking for delay index (1-31)

### Button Randomization
- **User**: Wanted to randomize which box is on the right and left each trial
- **Assistant**: Added randomization logic to reverse choice order 50% of the time, updated response interpretation to handle randomized positions

### Trial Flow Issues
- **User**: Reported screen goes blank after first trial choice, next trial doesn't arrive
- **Assistant**: Fixed closure issues by creating individual trial objects instead of using forEach loop with closures

### UI Improvements
- **User**: Wanted buttons to always be the same size
- **Assistant**: Added CSS styling with fixed dimensions (300x300px initially, later changed to 320x200px)

- **User**: Wanted to keep same color scheme but make buttons more square
- **Assistant**: Changed dimensions to 300x300px for square buttons

- **User**: Buttons in resting state were white instead of purple
- **Assistant**: Added comprehensive CSS selectors with `!important` declarations to override jsPsych defaults

### Mobile Optimization
- **User**: Asked to optimize buttons for mobile devices
- **Assistant**: Added responsive CSS with viewport-based sizing, touch-friendly dimensions, and proper touch event handling

- **User**: Text was hard to read on smaller screens
- **Assistant**: Increased font sizes and improved typography for mobile (20px tablets, 18px phones, 16px extra small)

- **User**: Wanted buttons slightly wider than they are high
- **Assistant**: Changed dimensions to 350x250px (1.4:1 aspect ratio)

- **User**: Wanted to decrease box size and increase font size
- **Assistant**: Reduced to 320x200px with 22px font size

### Mobile Touch Feedback
- **User**: Buttons don't visually change when pressed on mobile
- **Assistant**: Added touch event handlers and `.pressed` class for consistent visual feedback across devices

### Instruction Screen
- **User**: Wanted to add instruction screen at beginning
- **Assistant**: Added instruction trial with specified text and "Begin" button

- **User**: Instruction screen didn't show up
- **Assistant**: Fixed template literal syntax and added cache-busting to ensure latest code loads

- **User**: Wanted line breaks after first and second sentences
- **Assistant**: Added `<br><br>` tags for proper paragraph spacing

- **User**: Wanted to reduce size of Begin button
- **Assistant**: Added `.begin-btn` class with smaller dimensions (200x60px)

### Qualtrics Integration
- **User**: Needed JavaScript code for Qualtrics survey integration
- **Assistant**: Created `qualtrics.js` with self-contained task code that loads from GitHub Pages and saves data to Embedded Data

- **User**: Qualtrics returned syntax error on line 52
- **Assistant**: Replaced modern JavaScript syntax (`?.` and `??`) with ES5-compatible code

- **User**: Button styling was gone and only one trial showed in Qualtrics
- **Assistant**: Added CSS directly to Qualtrics code and created self-contained timeline instead of relying on external `main.js`

### Delay Adjustment Logic Issues
- **User**: Delay adjustment not working correctly - same step change regardless of choice
- **Assistant**: Fixed closure issues by creating individual trials instead of loop-generated ones

- **User**: Delay adjustment works for "$500 now" but not for delayed reward choices
- **Assistant**: Fixed choice detection logic using `_isReversed` state instead of unreliable `findIndex()`

- **User**: Delay times not changing consistently, adjustment logic not being followed
- **Assistant**: Corrected the adjustment logic to match Koffarnus & Bickel methodology:
  - Choose delayed → delay decreases (easier next time)
  - Choose immediate → delay increases (harder next time)

## Final Implementation

### Files Created/Modified
1. **`main.js`** - Core task logic with 5 adaptive trials
2. **`index.html`** - Browser interface with responsive CSS and touch handling
3. **`qualtrics.js`** - Self-contained Qualtrics integration code
4. **`README.md`** - Updated documentation
5. **`CHAT_LOG.md`** - This conversation log

### Key Features Implemented
- ✅ 5-trial adaptive delay discounting task
- ✅ Randomized button positions
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design
- ✅ Touch feedback on mobile devices
- ✅ Instruction screen with proper formatting
- ✅ Qualtrics integration with data export
- ✅ Correct delay adjustment logic
- ✅ Purple button styling (#8c58db)
- ✅ Proper bounds checking (delay index 1-31)

### Technical Solutions
- Fixed closure issues in trial generation
- Implemented proper choice detection with randomization
- Added comprehensive CSS overrides for jsPsych
- Created self-contained Qualtrics code to avoid external dependencies
- Used ES5-compatible JavaScript for Qualtrics compatibility
- Implemented touch event handling for mobile feedback

### Data Collection
- Records `data.delay` (boolean) and `data.index` (array) for each trial
- Saves to Qualtrics Embedded Data as JSON
- Includes final delay index and label for analysis

## Methodology Compliance
The implementation follows Koffarnus & Bickel (2014) "A 5-trial adjusting delay discounting task: Accurate discount rates in less than 60 seconds" with:
- Initial delay of 3 weeks (index 16)
- Step sizes of 8, 4, 2, 1
- Proper convergence logic
- Randomized choice presentation
